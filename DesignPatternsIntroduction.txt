Design Patterns

As we have multiple design patterns, an effective way to remember them is to divide them into categories:

Creational - Deal with the process of creation of objects of classes.
             It might be used when your object reqwuires multiple objects (multiple instances) before it can be created.
	     Another example of usage is when you want only one object your app (an object for app's configuration, for example).
	     Some of them:
	     • Builder
	     • Simple Factory
	     • Protoype
	     • Singleton
	     • Abstract Factory
	     • Object Pool

Structural - Deal with how classes and objects are arranged or composed.

Behavioral - Describe how classes and objects interact and commuinicate with each other.
